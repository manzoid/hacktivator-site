title: How to learn this stuff

## Go wide more than deep

There are obviously lots of things to review and lots of new things to learn, as well.

Given your time constraints, you can't afford to go too, too deep into any one topic or any one theme.

## Go deep enough to make connections

When we said above "things to learn", it implies that learning is oriented around individual "things".

However, your most powerful, applicable learning comes from the connections between things.

Solving any real problem involves marshalling your knowledge of multiple things at once.

Don't fall into the trap of approaching your interview prep like studying for a multiple-choice quiz.

## They're not just quizzing you

Enlightened interviewers, the kinds you would want to work with, are not out to [make you feel bad or to feel good about themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WL_jkFS2gw#t=0m30s).

They really want you to succeed, because they painfully / excitedly need help. They have a lot of work to do and are talking to you because they have an early sense you might be able to do it with them.

If you are able to do the basics cleanly, then you are likely to pattern-match as somebody with enough promise to take a chance on.

The words "basics" and "cleanly", though, have a lot packed into them. The next points offer ways to address that.

## Learn the underlying concepts and apply them widely

The core concepts cut across everything and emerge everywhere, which helps you manage and quickly make sense of the large volume of individual topics.

Whereas if you approach learning in a disjointed, isolated, random way, it takes much longer and you're likely to leave gaping holes.

## Don't worry about most of the details

There's a ton of detail in every topic and every tool, but in practical terms you don't need to worry about most of it.

Yeah JavaScript has [typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) (what, really?) and [WeakMaps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap) and [Symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) and stuff. That stuff can be cool for more-advanced things, but right now YAGNI (you ain't gonna need it).

## Become fluent in a small, practical subset of your chosen tools

If you don't remember the basics about your tools, and have to keep googling tons of basic stuff, you can't solve anything efficiently.

1. It takes precious time to google and sift through results. Or it takes precious time to ask your interviewer, if google is disallowed.
1. Frequent lookup keeps you thinking at a too low-level; your actual problem resides at a higher level than syntax etc.
1. It distracts you dangerously by encouraging you to think negative thoughts about how you are such a n00b and what the interviewer must be thinking about how much you need to look stuff up, etc.
