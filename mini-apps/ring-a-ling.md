## Description

The Ring-a-Ling 3000 is a state of the art digital alarm clock.

Make a working digital clock that allows you to set an alarm that goes off at a given time. When it goes off, it plays some sound.

### Testing

Unit test that the alarms go off at the right time.

    <summary>Hint</summary>
Your system should not directly tie itself to the current live time, or you won't be able to test it properly. This is analogous to real-life clocks generally needing to be "set".

### Frameworks and libraries

Use what you want, but personally I'm fine with you just using native built-in stuff, no frameworks.  You'll find that that's faster in interviews anyway a lot of the time. Less stuff to wire together, less boilerplate to type out.  Less stuff you type, the fewer typos you have.
