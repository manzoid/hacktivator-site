## What is a function?

Functions map **input** to **output**.

Let's look at a simple function, as defined in a programming language:

```
const square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

This function maps all valid values of `x` to their squared values.

So that's fine, right? However, this is **also** a function in a programming language:

```
const square = function(x) {
  console.log(x * x);
}
```

From the perspective of the caller, _this_ function does **nothing at all**. There is no return value; it returns `undefined`, by default.  Instead, there is a *side effect* -- a value is printed to the console, unbeknownst to the caller.

That's actually kind of Bad, because it makes the system more mysterious, less predictable.

## Mathematical functions

Let's take a brief detour into the world of mathematical functions. Programming functions derive directly from mathematical functions, and inspecting them can help us write better programs.

What's a mathematical function?

A mathematical function maps a "domain" to a "range". This just means mapping one set of values to another set of values.

For this function...
<table>
  <tr><td><strong>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup></strong></td></tr>
</table>

... the mapping looks like this:
<table>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>16</td></tr>
</table>

Here are some important characteristics to note about mathematical functions that make them useful to consider when writing programming functions.

### Mathematical functions are RELIABLE

Given some input, a valid mathematical function will only map to one output.

No matter how many times you supply that input, a given function will keep producing the same output.

That makes the function reliable and easy to reason about.

### Mathematical functions are SELF-CONTAINED

Math functions only accept input.

There is no concept of global state. They do not refer to values other than the input.

This aspect of being self-contained means that they are tidy, predictable black boxes. A change in some value outside of the function will not have an impact on the working of the function.

### Mathematical functions have no SIDE EFFECTS

Math functions only evaluate to their output.

Again, there is no concept of global state. They do not affect values outside themselves.

This aspect of having no side effects means that they are tidy, predictable black boxes. The workings of the function will not randomly impact values outside the function.

### Mathematical functions DO ONE THING

Because math functions are self-contained and have no side effects, they can be understood as doing only one thing. They map input to output in some predetermined, completely reliable way. The nature and purpose of that mapping might be quite complex, but the function only performs that mapping.

### How this applies to programming

The features described above regarding mathematical functions are very useful in the programming world.

Composing a system from programming functions that are written to behave similarly to mathematical functions means it is a lot easier to reason about that system.

* There will be fewer bugs.
* It will be easier to debug the problems that do arise.
* It will be easier to understand and explain the system to others.
* It will be easier to safely extend it with new functionality.

### This is true even in small programs

Bugs, confusion, and difficulty of extension all happen even in small programs.

Decomposing your problem solution into a system of small, well-named, single-purpose functions with no side effects will reap benefits even at a small scale.
