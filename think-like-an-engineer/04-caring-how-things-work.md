## Limits to what we can know... yet...

There are naturally huge limits to what we can really know as we do our work.

The systems we build rely on thousands of components that we don't understand. For example, you do not understand _all_ the things that happen when you "simply" [press a key on your keyboard](../dizzying-invisible-depth). There is probably not a single person on the planet who has a full command of all the technologies that come into play at that moment.

Nonetheless, part of caring about the details is caring how things work, under the hood.

Just because knowing _everything_ about _everything_ is overwhelmingly complex doesn't mean we shouldn't know

* _everything_ about _some things_
* _some things_ about _many things_

A key challenge to your learning ahead is determining for yourself how to balance:

* deep understanding
* wide familiarity
* treating things as a black box
