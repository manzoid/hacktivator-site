title: "Engineering vs \"making things kinda work somehow\""
---

When you are first learning how to build systems, naturally, you don't really know what you're doing.

It's gratifying and pretty difficult to get anything to work at all.

That's A-OK for starters. Just don't _end_ there :)

Engineering a software solution involves coding, of course, but it is very different from just slapping code together to get the thing to work.

Engineering involves

* identifying constraints
* planning against those constraints
* coordinating with the needs and work of others
* forethought about edge cases
* actively forestalling those edge cases (or deciding to accept them as "per spec")
* designing a system of components that interact reliably via crisp interfaces
* implementing maintainable code
* verifying your work as you go
* being organized and careful about deployment of the system
* maintaining your live system

You're not _yet_ extending large production apps with live audiences. That will come in the near future.

But why not start thinking along these lines now?
