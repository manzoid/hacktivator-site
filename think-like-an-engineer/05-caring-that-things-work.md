title: "Caring *that* things really work"
---

A professional is someone who performs so well, they get paid to do what they do.

You might be surprised how often even nominally "professional" programmers improperly cut corners and don't deliver quality work.

What are some ways to fall short?

* Don't really know or check what "done" means (to others)
* Don't get technical design reviewed
* Don't bother writing any tests
* Only test part of the flow
* Only test the "happy path"
* Don't bother actually manually dev-testing (i.e., just trying out) your own running system
* Don't think about or prepare for edge cases
* Write messy code that gets the thing done but is unmaintainable, e.g., duplicative, hard-to-read, poorly structured
* Leave the code in that clunky state
* Jot down "to-do" comments to clean up these cut corners but never revisit them
* Don't get code reviewed
* Don't *follow up* on review feedback
* Don't take the time to set up tooling to reduce repetitive manual effort

And so on, and so on.

You can guess what we're going to say: "Don't be this person."

Quality requires effort. Take the time to make sure that things really work.

Make the best tradeoff you can amid all the constraints, but also go the extra 10% to get it really _done_.

The extra bit of effort to get _all the way done_, even at this early stage, actually makes things easier in the end. You'll understand things better, and your systems will run more smoothly. You'll spend less time debugging and more time jetting around the world popping champagne corks.

Well, at least the former.
