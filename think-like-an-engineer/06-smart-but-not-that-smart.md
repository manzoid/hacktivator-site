title: "Approaching complexity with humility"
---

It's easy for things to become way more complex than any single person can reasonably understand and work with.

We wind up _making_ them this way, inadvertently.

It's easy to throw together something that sorta-kinda seems to work -- for a little while -- but is just counterintuitive, with arbitrary aspect after arbitrary aspect. Parts are wired together messily. Components don't have contracts, or they're inconsistent. Seemingly random side effects and behaviors emerge. Changes in one part of the code affect parts of the code far away from the change site. The whole thing quickly becomes opaque, unpredictable, and crazy-making to deal with.

## We're smart but...

This is important to note because while we are all pretty smart... we really aren't all _that_ smart.

Some relevant quotes from pioneers of computer science:

> Competent programmers are fully aware of the strictly limited size of their own skulls; therefore they approach the programming task in full humility.

<br>

> Computer scientists' main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of their own making.

<br>

> There are two ways of constructing software: One is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
<br>

## The virtue of humility

You're smart. I'm smart. No doubt, or we wouldn't be talking to each other here. Yet, unbounded complexity will leap out of any system and knock any of us on our butt.

Even great programmers -- especially, great programmers -- treat complexity with wary respect, and avoid sloppiness.
