Consistency and predictability are highly desirable features of your code.

We mentioned this in passing earlier, but a key quality measure for you to strive for in your coding is *readability*.

Readable code is code that clearly communicates its intention to the reader. Code that is not readable takes longer to understand, is harder to safely change. It increases the likelihood of bugs and decreases your team's morale.

One of the most important aspects of readability is consistency. It is easier to understand the purpose of code if your code reader knows what to expect.

You want _semantic_ differences to jump out to the reader's eye -- not _syntactical_ differences.

You definitely should adhere to a style guide. I recommend [the AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Note that this isn't _the_ One Style Guide to Rule Them All, this is just one decent style guide. Practically speaking, it really doesn't matter _too_ much which style guide you use, as long as you adhere to it.

Your code editor should have a JavaScript linter [configured accordingly](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/linters).
