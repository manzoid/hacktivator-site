title: "Thinking at multiple levels of detail"
---

It's worth calling out a theme here: good engineers move seamlessly between multiple levels of detail.

Keeping track and making use of different levels of the same problem space in rapid succession is something that engineers have to do all the time, fluently and routinely.

As you hone your skills against substantial problems, you'll find yourself getting better and better at abstracting away inessential detail when you need to remember the _why_ of what you're doing. And on the other hand, when you need to dig into the details, you can summon them into focus, at will.

This is what it means to balance the details with the bigger picture.
